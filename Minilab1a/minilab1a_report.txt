I clicked create repository button and made it public. Then I clicked upload files and dragged my files in. Between the resource usage reports, I saw a considerably smaller amount of resources used in the NON-IP report compared to the IP one. Maybe this is because the non-ip module we created is much smaller scale whereas the IP one is prebuilt and made to adapt to different scales, such as a much larger one.
